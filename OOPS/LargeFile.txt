MLOps refers to the combination of DevOps principles with machine learning (ML) to streamline the ML model lifecycle, from deployment to continuous monitoring and improvement. This approach aims to optimize and standardize the processes involved in ML model management, ensuring models operate at peak efficiency and adapt to changing conditions.

Key Aspects of MLOps
Automated ML Pipelines: MLOps platforms automate processes across data preparation, model training, evaluation, validation, and prediction generation, enabling faster time-to-delivery.
Model Versioning and Management: MLOps enables centralized management of model versions, allowing for easy tracking, reproduction, and selection of the best-performing models for different business use cases.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): MLOps integrates ML models with traditional software development practices, enabling frequent model updates, retraining, and redeployment.
Active Performance Monitoring: MLOps provides real-time monitoring of model performance, enabling data scientists to identify issues, troubleshoot, and optimize models.
Benefits of MLOps
